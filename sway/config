# Include configs from 3 locations:
#  - /usr/share/sway/config.d
#  - /etc/sway/config.d
#  - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config.d ($HOME/.config/sway/config.d)
#
# If multiple directories contain the files with the same name, the later
# directory takes precedence; `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config.d/20-swayidle.conf`
# will always be loaded instead of `/usr/share/sway/config.d/20-swayidle.conf`
# or `/etc/sway/config.d/20-swayidle.conf`
#
# This mechanism permits overriding our default configuration per-system
# (/etc) or per-user ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME) basis. Just create the file you
# want to modify/override in the higher-level directory.
#
# For example, to disable the default bar from Fedora configs, you'll need to
#     $ echo -n > "$HOME/.config/sway/config.d/90-bar.conf"
#
# Note the quoting, the $() and the arguments quoting. All the parts are equally
# important to make the magic work. And if you want to learn the secret behind
# the trick, it's all in the `wordexp(3)`.
